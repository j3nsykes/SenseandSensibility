# SenseandSensibility
Teaching resources for a 3-week project exploring  exploring computer vision, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML)

## Main teaching webpage 
[HERE](https://j3nsykes.github.io/)

### Classification, Regression and Teachable Machine
These  examples all run in P5JS. direct links live on the teaching website but local copies can be downloaded here. 

### RunwayML
Within this folder are examples that build upon the existing RunwayML Processing library and further these interactions with text generating chat bots, motorised outputs and sound to name a few. Have an explore!
There are also some P5JS examples and relating Arduino code for sending serial comms. 

### DIY Neural Nets
These examples live  in the P5JS editor and can be linked to from the teaching webpage. Local copies can be downlaoded from this repository. The examples show how to use the ML5 Neural Net function to build templates for Physical Computing inputs.
